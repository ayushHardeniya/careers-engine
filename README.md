## Overview

**careers-engine** is an open source backend that continuously discovers software engineering opportunities, normalizes and enriches the collected data, and publishes newly discovered opportunities through automated workflows.

The project eliminates manual tracking of company career pages by providing a reproducible pipeline for job discovery, storage, and publishing. It currently powers **ZenYukti Jobs**, while remaining modular enough to support additional sources, publishers, and deployment environments.
